In this assignment we will be covering Dockerfile:
First: Create a Docker file that will print "Hello Ninja" for you. But if you will pass your name then it should print "Hello {YOUR-FULL-NAME}"
Second: Build Dockerfile for our Spring3Hibernate Application. Note that How much time it is taking in building and How much memory Docker Image is consuming. 
Now start working on minimising the docker image Build Time and as well as size. Run the docker image and show the difference.

Third: Make a Single Dockerfile to setup Spring3Hibernate App and MySQL and make sure both are able to connect with each other and application is able to store data 
as well. (edited)
