## What you will learn from this lab
- S3
- Hosting a static site in s3
- Cloudfront (CDN)
- Route 53

## Task Description 
- Create 2 S3 buckets 
    -  With console (bucket name = ninja) 
    -  With CLI (bucket name= BuddyName) 
- create 2 index.html page 
    - With content "Hi ninja" 
    - With "Hi buddy name"
- Upload index.html with "Hi ninja" using AWS console on ninja bucket.
- Upload index.html inside folder 'ninja', with "Hi Buddy" using AWS CLI  on BuddyName bucket.
- Configure CloudFront for both s3 buckets in such a fashion that CloudFront should open "Hi ninja" on default and cloudfront dns/ninja should display "Hi buddy"
 **S3 should not be publicly open (Only accessible through CloudFront using bucket policy and OAI)**
- Arrange a domain from any registrar(eg: try to get it free or cheapest ;-) )  
- Create a public hosted zone with the existing domain
- Now create a recordset  for mapping your  CloudFront DNS with {your_name}.{your_domain} which is hosting your previously created website 
    - eg: Pankaj.crazy traveller.ga should open your website. (where "Pankaj" is name and "dcrazytraveller.ga" is your domain)

##  Good To Do
- Create a private hosted zone (choice of your domain) and attach it to your VPC.
- Now create a recordset  for mapping your  CloudFront DNS with {your_buddy_name}.{your_domain} which is hosting your previously created website 
- Do the same activity as done in the public-hosted zone.
    - Now try accessing it from your local machine.
    - Create an EC2 instance in your VPC and try accessing the same domain from your machine.
