* create AMI from one of ec2 server that you created in earlier task (the nginx one)
* Create ASG and launch template with above AMI. (min:1 , desired: 1 max: 4)
* Attach ASG with TG you created in earlier task (the nginx one)
* Create scaling policy CPU > 50%
* Now generate high CPU in exixting ec2 server so that it crosses 50% CPU and ASG should add more ec2 instances.
* Remove high CPU load .. ASG should set instance count to 1 after sometime
