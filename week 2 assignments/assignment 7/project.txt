Google form assignment
You've been given three spreadsheets
1 - class 6A - source of truth
2 - Google form responses
3 - Resultant sheet
Sheet 1 - the source of truth and contains all correct information
Sheet 2 -  google form response. It may contain wrong information as students can give wrong information
Sheet 3 - Required sheet where we want marks of each student against their name
There are three columns to verify a student's identity in Google form sheet
Email - Which contains admission number
Name - Where students wrote their name
Admission number - Where students wrote their admission number
For each student, match the above three colums from "source of truth sheet" to verify the student identity and then update their marks in output sheet
Update marks only when atleast two of the three columns have right information. 
If only name column matches write NA in marks column as name can be common
If all three mismatch write NA in marks column.
eg.
./updateMarks.sh -classfile 6A.csv -gform form.csv
output
marks.csv

-> class6A
