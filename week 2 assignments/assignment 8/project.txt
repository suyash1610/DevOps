## Must Do
- Installation of webservers
- Please perform below mentioned acivities once the nginx/apache is installed
## Ip Based Virtual Hosting
    - Create a static website with basic html which should open using system IP | Done
    - Create a static website with IP Based Virtual Hosting, should only open when hit using specific ip. For example it should open with 127.0.0.1 only | Done
    - Create multiple static websites within the server having different web pages serving different content when hit using respective IP. For example, 
      it should serve "Hi! Welcome to Ninja Program. You've reached localhost" when you hit on 127.0.0.1 where as it should serve "Hi! Welcome to Ninja Program. You've 
      reached Pvt. IP" when you hit your server using private IP
## Name Based Virtual Hosting
    - Create a static website which should serve one page when hit using http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com and a different page if hit using IP.
    - Should have nginx config which can serve "Hi! This is <your-name>, and I am a ninja" when you hit using http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com and should 
      serve "I am here to become a Devops Engineer" when hit using http://<your-name>.otninja.com.
## Nginx Path Based Routing
    - Create a website, it should serve "Welcome to my website" when hit using http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com and should serve 
      "This is <your-name>'s home page" when hit using http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com/home
## Redirection http to http and http to https
    - Configure your nginx config in a way that if you hit http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com, it should redirect you to http://<your-name>.redirect.opstreeninja.com
    - Configure your nginx config in a way that if you hit http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com, it should redirect you to http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com/home and 
      should serve "Welcome to this website"
    - Configure your nginx in a way that you hit http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com, it should return https://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com
## Return Custom message
    - Configure your nginx config so that if a user hit http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com/bot, it should return 504 to the end user
    - Configure your nginx config so that if a user hit http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com/opstree, it should return "Not Authorized" 
      ( This has to be done from nginx config itself) 
## METHOD Filtering
    - Configure your nginx config so that only GET method is allowed on your website http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com, requests with other methods should 
      get "405" error
## User Request Control
    - Configure your nginx config so that it should allow 5 hits only to your website http://<your-name>.opstreeninja.com from a particular IP, 
      more than 5 hits in a minute should be blocked
## Nginx Proxy setup
    - Create a setup where nginx config should be running on 80 port.
    - Install tomcat
    - Config running with 80 port should route traffic to downstream applications which is running on 8080 port (tomcat).
## Good to Do
- Install nginx from source, without using package manager. You have to build and configure it in your system itself.
