Run adhoc commands based on the following conditions:

- Due to resources constraint, Run specific commands on all remote hosts one at a time.
- Setup solution which collects the minimal amount of system-related information from a remote host 
- Change the location of the default inventory file without using the Adhoc flag
- Create an inventory file with the .py extension and update the file path in the config file. But while running the commands that inventory file should not work.
- While using Ansible ad-hoc command without any module, it should print ping-pong output
- Due to security reasons, the organization modified the SSH default port to some random port, make sure while using ansible, we don't have to provide or change 
  ansible port for every host and it should work for all.
- ### While using Ansible, it should pick random user [ example - ninja ] as default instead of root.
- While login into remote servers, it should use the default private key if not provided.
- As display output doesn't require color output, how can we disable colors from the output while using ansible commands
- How can we get information of remote hosts which have failed to execute properly and rerun the same commands only for failed hosts
- Run commands on the basis of different strategy and how it is different from each other. Use at least 4 hosts
